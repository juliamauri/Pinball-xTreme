We do a copy of the starsky y hutch pinball, with Box2D.
This is a big proyect because we try to do a exactly copy of it. We upload a flash archive that contains all the sprites with vector graphics. 
This was bad for us, because we need thirds programms to convert this image in a aviable format to transform with the photoshop. We waste to many time with this and we had to change our 
maind. We had to reduce some mechanics from the original game. 

Diference between original game and our pinball:

- When the ball complete the diferents ways of the game three times to find the criminals. We had to shoot the ball on the multiball place to get locked the criminals. Our ball will dissapear and remplaced for another. 
To get the multiball we need to repeat the process another time and then will appear on the exit of the pipe the first ball that locks the criminals and our ball. (We didn't do this mechanics)
Another mechanic that we didn't implemented is the space. On the original game if we press the space the pinball simulates a vertical movement that give movement on the ball. We can press the space all the time
and we can do infinitive combos whith the sensors because the ball didn't fall. (We don't implement this mechanics because we think that is easy to get a big score.)
- We don't implement some sensors and decoration items because we don't have time. We waste to many time doing mask colisions and we don't control well the time. We fail with the left tube mask because 
  we didn't control well the mask collisions, to open with a sensor the mask of the pipe and closer when the ball isn't in contact with the sensor.
- When we get activated the three sensors of the top, we get a x2 bonus. If we repeat the proces, will add +1 on the bonus.
- Also when we activated the three circle sensor of the right or left map, will open a small tube that will safe the ball if it falls in the hole. After this the tube closers. 

Problems: 

The principal problem for us is the complexity of the painball and the time, we focused on the artistic part to did well the pinball. We need to extract all the audios playing the game and editing the sounds, we extract at finally 
all the imatges with photoshop. This did that we got all the matirial to did well the pinball but is to long to add all this decorative items on the painball, and we decided to focus on the principal gameplay.


God Mode:

With F1 will see our chains.
With "1" will spawn a ball on the same place as the mause position.
With "2" will aplly a a force on the y axis to move the ball. 

Rules:

With the right arrow, we will move the right flipper.
With the left arrow, we will move the left flipper.
With the bottom arrow, we will move the shuttle to give movement at ball.
With the "r", we will reset the game.
